# Face Recognition Attendance System

An advanced, real-time face recognition-based attendance tracker built using Python. This project detects and identifies faces through a webcam or video feed and logs attendance automatically, providing a seamless and efficient solution to replace traditional manual methods.

 Features
- Face Detection & Recognition: Identifies faces in real-time using a webcam or video feed.
- Automated Attendance Logging: Records attendance in a structured and easily manageable format (e.g., CSV file).
- Real-Time Processing: Processes video frames instantly for fast and accurate face recognition.
- Scalable: Easily adaptable for classrooms, offices, or events with multiple participants.

 Technologies Used
- Python: Primary programming language for development.
- OpenCV: For real-time video capture and image processing.
- Face Recognition Library: Built on dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition.
- NumPy: For handling data arrays.

 Installation
Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd face-recognition-attendance
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:
   Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.7 or later). Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Project**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Add Face Data**:
   Place images of individuals in the `images` folder. Each image should be named after the person’s name (e.g., `John.jpg`).

 How It Works
1. The system captures video feed from your webcam.
2. Detects and identifies faces in the feed using pre-trained face recognition models.
3. Matches the detected faces with the known faces stored in the `images` folder.
4. Logs the recognized individuals’ names and timestamps in an attendance file.

Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Webcam or external camera for face detection
- Libraries: OpenCV, face_recognition, NumPy

Future Improvements
- Add a GUI for ease of use.
